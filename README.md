Implementation of zero-knowledge proof circuits for [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/).

## Overview

Tendermint X's core contract is `TendermintX`, which stores the headers of Tendermint blocks. Users can query a `TendermintX` contract for the header of a specific block height, or for the latest header.

There are two entrypoints to a `TendermintX` contract, `step` and `skip`.

### skip

`skip` is used to jump from the current header to a non-consecutive header.

For example, let's say block N has already been proven in the light client, and we want to prove block N+10. We can skip from block N to block N+10 if 1) the validators who have signed the commit for block N+10 comprise > 1/3 of the voting power on block N and 2) validators comprimising > 2/3 of the voting power on block N+10 have signed the commit for block N+10.

The methodology for doing so is described in the section 6 of [A Tendermint Light Client](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07031.pdf).

### step

`step` is used to sequentially verify the next header after the current header.

This is rarely used, as `step` will only be invoked when the validator set changes by more than 2/3 in a single block.

## Deployment

The circuits are currently available on Succinct X [here](https://alpha.succinct.xyz/succinctlabs/tendermintx).

There are currently Tendermint X light clients tracking the following networks on Goerli:

- [dYdX](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x59eE2D9CFaC933c79Cc1D1d6767679636c0b539D#events)
- [Osmosis](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xd4a723C4dd8a961ACcbC5a42f05862C63B32B701#events)
- [Celestia Mainnet](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x0E9187150C3eEFcBce4E2a15aEC0136f45f4d6B2#events)

## Integrate Tendermint X

1. Request a Succinct Platform API Key: https://alpha.succinct.xyz/partner

2. Fork this repository: https://github.com/succinctlabs/tendermintx

3. Update the `VALIDATOR_SET_SIZE_MAX` to match that of your Tendermint chain in `circuits/consts.rs` (ex. 150 for Osmosis, 60 for dYdX). Push the changes to your fork.

4. Go to the [Succinct Platform](https://alpha.succinct.xyz).

5. Sign up for an account on the platform.

6. Create a new project on the Succinct Platform by importing your fork of `tendermintx`.

7. In your project on the platform, go to `Releases`. Create two new releases, one for `step` and one for `skip`. Use the `main` branch and set the entrypoint accordingly.

8. In your project on the platform, go to `Settings`. Set `TENDERMINT_RPC_URL` in `Environment Variables`. This should be a valid full node RPC for your Tendermint chain.

9. Once the releases are completed building, go to `Deployments` to deploy the verifiers for `step` and `skip`.

10. Open the code for your fork of `TendermintX` again.

11. Fetch the trusted initialization parameters of the Tendermint X light client from a chain RPC. Add `TENDERMINT_RPC_URL` for your chain to your `.env` and then run `cargo run --bin genesis -- --block N`, where N is the initialization height of the light client. `N` and the corresponding hash of block `N` will be used as `GENESIS_HEIGHT` and `GENESIS_HEADER` in `contracts/.env` in the next step.

12. Update `contracts/.env` accoridng to `contracts/.env.example`. Note: The genesis parameters are typically sourced from a recent header from your Tendermint chain.

13. Deploy your `TendermintX` contract and initialize it with your function ID & genesis parameters using the commands below.

```
forge install

forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $ETHEREUM_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY --verify TendermintX --broadcast
```

13. Update `.env` according to `.env.example`.

14. Run `TendermintX` script to update the light client continuously (currently set to update once every 4 hours).

```
cargo run --bin tendermintx --release
```

14. Now, go the platform to monitor the status of your proofs. Generating a Tendermint LC proof takes anywhere from 4-15 minutes, depending on your validator set size.

### Tendermint RPC's

To find a list of RPC's for most Tendermint chains, check out [this page](https://deving.zone/en/cosmos/chains) created by @deving_zone.

### Block Protocol Version

Tendermint X is configured to work with [CometBFT block protocol version 11](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ben2077/cometbft/version#pkg-constants). If this changes in the future, the Tendermint X circuits might need to be updated.

## Audit

### Informal Audit

- Tendermint X has been audited by Informal Systems. The audit report can be found [here](audits/informal/audit.pdf).
